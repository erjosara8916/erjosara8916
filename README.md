## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª **Backend Developer NodeJs**

I am loving of technology, and I am happy to work with it. I have been great opportunities to work for amazing international and local projects, working beside professional development teams. I have been trying a lot of interesting technologies, I like learning about trending topics like DevOps, Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design, and others, so I usually take some time to read or take a course about it.

**Transform monolith app into a microservices architecture**

- **Type of company:** Delivery App
- **Project:** Migrate several parts of a legacy Super App platform that was developed in a monolithic way to microservices, improving the overall performance, since it did not support having a few users online. This platform was intended only for vertical scaling but in the cloud, this is quite expensive.
- **Position/role:** Back End Developer - Analyze current project solution, built on PHP, to propose a microservice architecture improving app performance. Develop microservices from scratch, resolving the same use cases for all clients were using that backend (Web/Android/ IOS Applications), also, it was developed, an image microservice taking the storing out of the main server. This project was built using NodeJS, exposing the same HTTP resources as the previous services in PHP, giving a better performance to the platform
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, ExpressJS, MySql, GCP, MySql, PHP`**

**Design/construction/deployment, for a delivery app, into microservice architecture**

- **Type of company:** Delivery App
- **Project:** Backend microservices for a new delivery application in development, In the required modules are: Stores, Products, Images storing, Application, an Event handler for sales integrated with Zoho Books
- **Position/role:** Back End Developer - Propose a microservice architecture for all modules required. Develop microservices from scratch, designing and building a REST API exposing all services. This project was completely based on serverless architecture using NodeJS. Also, it was developed some microservices to manage sell events, sending their data to Zoho Books (A countable application) and storing them as Big Data to get reports later.
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Typescript, ExpressJS, MySql, GCP`**

**Scraping system for stores**

- **Type of company:** Delivery App
- **Project:** The company wanted to have popular stores in its application for their users, so the requirement was a microservice to take all data about products and offers in those stores and update data in the company application delivery
- **Position/role:** Back End Developer - There was already a microservice running, so my function was to present a proposal for a new version to improve topics like automation, independence, architecture, and create new scripts to take data from new stores. The solution was built in nodeJs using MongoDB for data persistence. There were created APIs exposing external interaction but the magic of that architecture was in the microservices' communication across events.
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Typescript, ExpressJS, MySql, MongoDB, GCP`**

**Transform monolith app Java into a microservices architecture with nodeJS**

- **Type of company:** Enterprise products for companies
- **Project:** Migrate building technologies for a google workspace application. This application has been used by companies to manage their email signatures. The company wanted to migrate the application technologies to NodeJs and serverless architecture
- **Position/role:** Backend Developer NodeJs, Cloud Engineer. Define the new microservices and technologies for them, also the new relation among components. This project was built in NodeJS based on a serverless architecture using producs offers by google like Google Cloud Run for APIs, and Google Cloud functions for events managment from PubSub, also was created some integrations with External Services
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Typescript, ExpressJS, MySql, Google Workspace, GCP, Zoho CRM, Zoho Subscriptions, Zoho Books`**

**Bitcoin Payment Gateway**

- **Type of company:** Software Development
- **Project:** After the approval of bitcoin in El Salvador, the company wanted to give an offer for the businesses as Payment Gateway Solution
- **Position/role:** Backend Developer, Cloud Engineer. Learn about the bitcoin technology, how does it work? how can it use? What about related technologies? etc. This project was based on an Open Source Solutions adding new features, like the integration with Chivo Wallet application proposed by the government (Chivo wallet can't pay external invoices). The Open Source Solution had some bugs so it was required to resolve them. The principal technologies were C# and Docker. For this project was required the Bitcoin nodes administration and lightning network (channels, balance, etc)
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Typescript, NestJs, C#, GCP, Azure, Chivo Services, Docker, PostgreSQL, Bitcoin, Lightning Network, BigQuery`**

**Stripe Webhooks handler microservices**

- **Type of company:** City
- **Project:** The company has used Stripe as Payment Gateway for its services, so they wanted to automatize all events with their account of Xero CRM (all operations were manual  before)
- **Position/role:** Backend Developer, Cloud Engineer. Define the entire architecture for the requirements. This project was built on Node Js. The company had been used functions as a Service for its backend, so the proposed architecture was similar. The project was built on NodeJs. The bigger proposition for this project was to take the control of deployments, since they had all one in a unique step, reducing a lot of the time and cost of deployments
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Typescript, Serverless, GCP PubSub, GCP, Firestore, BigQuery, Xero CRM, Stripe`**

**Realtime Report for employee activity**

- **Type of company:** Riders App similar to Uber
- **Project:** The company uses a platform to manage its employees and check their activity in real-time. So they wanted to get reports about the employee's activity across the time, they wanted to know if the employees were online during the time assigned
- **Position/role:** Backend Developer - Cloud Engineer. Analyze and propose an architecture to implement the requirement. This project was built using nodeJs, storing data in Google Cloud BigQuery, showing data in Google Cloud Data Studio, and programming microservice execution with Google Cloud Scheduler
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Firestore,  Serverless, GCP, Data Studio`**

**Zoho products  integrations**

- **Type of company:** Telecommunications
- **Project:** The Company uses the Zoho platform and its products to manage its operations. Organizing and planning the activity of their employees with Zoho Projects. Managing their financial operations with Zoho Books, and controlling their clients, contracts, employees, and other information with Zoho CRM. They did want custom integrations for the platform responding to specific events
- **Position/role:** Backend Developer - Cloud Architect -  Analyze all processes of the company and their operations proposing improvements and automation across Zoho modules, taking advantage of webhooks, rest API, and google cloud products. The project was built in Node JS implementing serverless architecture using GCP PubSub as an event handler sending data to Cloud Functions that call the backend as a service provided by Zoho Platform
- **Technologies/frameworks: `NodeJs, Serverless, GCP, Zoho Projects, Zoho Books, Zoho CRM, Zoho Recruits`**
